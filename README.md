You can choose between 15 different topics. (e.g. general knowlege, film, musik, computer-science) <br>
Within these you can choose between 3 levels of difficulty. (easy, medium, hard)<br><br>

After selecting the game settings and hitting the <strong>start</strong> button, you will get 10 questions with 4 possible answers each.<br>
After selecting an answer, or to skip a question hit the <strong>next question</strong> button.<br>
The app tracks your score of correctly answered questions and your progress<br><br>

With the api-request the app receives a session token, to make sure that you don't get the same questions again in one session.<br>
This token expires after 6 hours or when you close the app.<br><br>

Have fun!<br><br>
